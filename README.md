Hi,👋
I am a Frontend Software Engineer with experience building real-world, user-facing products at scale.
I specialize in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, with a strong focus on frontend architecture,
complex workflows, and clean integration with backend APIs.

I’ve worked on production systems such as online travel platforms (OTA micro-sites, booking
flows, partner integrations) and enterprise ERP applications, contributing to features used
by real users in business-critical contexts.
